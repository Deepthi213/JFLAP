# JFLAP
 JFLAP Modified UI

â€” JFLAP (Java version of Formal Language and Automata Package) is an educational software tool written in Java for learning Automata theory. I have modified the open source code of JFLAP 7.1 by integrating it to a single window, improving naming conventions, providing redirections and have added various options for text field, hovering, watermark.
These modifications provide an enhanced visualization of JFLAP for gaining more flexibility while using the tool.
